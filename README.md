OC-BBR
Optimized coupled BBR (OC-BBR)  for multipath TCP.

The BBR TCP congestion control algorithm is known for its ability to improve throughput and reduce queuing delay. Within this repository, we have made updates to the BBR congestion control algorithm to accommodate MPTCP by incorporating the coupled congestion control principle from the Linked Increase algorithm (LIA).

#Instructions:
How to Run:

Just compile and install is as a module. Change the default Congestion Algorithm to OC-BBR"
Above development was based on the MPTCP v0.96 deployed in Linux kernel version of 5.15.0-67-generic.
